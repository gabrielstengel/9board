    9-Board is a sophisticated version of normal tic-tac-toe.
    There are nine classic boards, 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe boards make up a 3-by-3
    array. Players take turns making marks (human 'X', computer 'O') in the
    ordinary tic-tac-toe boards. The first mark can appear anywhere. Each
    subsequent mark gets made in any un-marked spot in the ordinary board that
     corresponds to the spot where the previous mark got made. The usual
     3-in-a-row arrangement of marks in any of the 9 ordinary boards wins.
